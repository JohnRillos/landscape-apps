# Groups and Talk

Start, host, and cultivate communities with Groups. Own your communications, organize your resources, and share documents. Groups is a decentralized platform that integrates with Talk, Notebook, and Gallery for a full, communal suite of tools.

Send encrypted direct messages to one or many friends with Talk. Talk is a simple chat tool for catching up, getting work done, and everything in between.
